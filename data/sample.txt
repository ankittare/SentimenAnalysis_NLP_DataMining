i stumbled upon this camera after much research  its hard to understand why this camera is so hard to find when every pro review site has given it very high marks  i was considering the minolta dimage s404 canon g2 canon s40 olympus d40 pentax optio 430 before i discovered the casio  all of these cameras received good reviews but only the canon g2 was higher than the casio  however the casio uses the exact same lens as the canon g2  the casio is a great camera  when you first take it out of the box you realize that the camera is built very well  everything is laid out nicely  it comes with a neck strap that is very comfortable  i have used a 21 mgpxl camera for the last year and a half  it was a good camera but seemed to always be in the camera bag when i wanted to take a picture  on our last trip to disneyland i missed a lot of good shots  this camera has an excellent lens all glass and quality ccd sony  together they produce great pictures  i have three children the youngest is 7 weeks  i took a closeup of the youngest and printed an 8x10 to see how it would look using a hp photosmart p1000  it was astonishing  i could not see any pixelation whatsoever  without a magnifying glass there is no way you could tell it was digital  with the 41 megapixels you can reduce the size of the files and still have a very high quality output for emailing  this camera also has a ton of manual options that give you great control of your pictures  most of the manual settings are accessed with dial controls not through the menu  this is a plus this camera also uses nimh batteries  this is great because you will always have batteries ready to go  one pro review site rated this camera as one of the best theyd ever seen for battery life  they said they had no idea how casio achieved this but were glad they did  the memory type is very versatile as well  you can use compact flash type i and ii as well as a microdrive up to 1 gig  you will never run out of memory options here  the camera also has a very informative lcd threaded lens and external flash option  the camera looks good feels good and takes great pictures  factor in the relatively low cost and you have yourself a fun piece of equipment  i knew when i bought the 21 mgpxl camera it would be replaced quickly  however i know this camera will be around for a long time  </TEXT>

note i have the japanese version of this camera the only difference though is the name of the camera finepix 1200 and the fact that the user manual and software are in japanese    i got this camera because i wanted an inexpensive decent digital camera so far it has been prettymuch everything i thought it would be the pictures are good and sharp as long as i dont move while the camera is snapping the picture and the menus are easy to use and logically laid out the camera fits easily into my hand and doesnt have any odd protrusions that make it difficult to use  i really like how long the batteries last ive used other digital cameras in the past that drain batteries faster than i can buy or recharge them i know color lcd screens use a lot of power and im glad fuji came up with one that doesnt consume the power quite as quickly i also like how the display can be turned off to conserve battery power  the smartmedia card is a very convenient way to store the pictures its small and transfers the data quickly to the computer i do recommend getting a smartmedia card reader though so you dont have to waste battery power when you transfer pictures to your computer  there are only three things i really dislike about this camera the quotzoomquot no dc power cord included and the software that comes with the camera  first of all the quotzoomquot is just a little switch on one end of the camera it would have been nice for it to be automatic though im sure that would have raised the price the closeup setting is for really close closeups within about 1 inch if you try to use it any other time the pictures will be blurry most of the time you will use the camera on the landscape zoom setting or quotinfinityquot focus  second there is no dc power cord included with the camera so unless you spend more money to get one you have to either buy a smartmedia card reader or waste battery power to download pictures  third the software that comes with the camera is really quite awful i recommend not installing it and buying your own imagemanipulation software such as adobe photoshop i also recommend buying a smartmedia card reader as i mentioned above as this will handle the transfer of files much better than the included software youll also be able to use the card reader with any other device that uses smartmedia cards such as mp3 players for instance  overall this is a great lowend digital camera it has its drawbacks but it does the job and its easy to usebrbr   </TEXT>
