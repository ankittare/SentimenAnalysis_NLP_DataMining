            I stumbled upon this camera after much research.  It's hard to understand why this camera is so hard to find; when every pro review site has given it very high marks.  I was considering the Minolta Dimage S404, Canon G2, Canon S40, Olympus D-40, Pentax Optio 430 before I discovered the Casio.  All of these camera's received good reviews, but only the Canon G2 was higher than the Casio.  However, the casio uses the exact same lens as the Canon G2.  The Casio is a great camera.  When you first take it out of the box, you realize that the camera is built very well.  Everything is laid out nicely.  It comes with a neck strap that is very comfortable.  I have used a 2.1 mgpxl camera for the last year and a half.  It was a good camera, but seemed to always be in the camera bag when I wanted to take a picture.  On our last trip to Disneyland, I missed a lot of good shots.  This camera has an excellent lens (all glass) and quality CCD (Sony).  Together they produce great pictures.  I have three children, the youngest is 7 weeks.  I took a close-up of the youngest and printed an 8x10 to see how it would look (using a HP Photosmart P1000).  It was astonishing.  I could not see any pixelation what-so-ever.  Without a magnifying glass, there is no way you could tell it was digital.  With the 4.1 megapixels, you can reduce the size of the files, and still have a very high quality output for e-mailing.  This camera also has a ton of manual options that give you great control of your pictures.  Most of the manual settings are accessed with dial controls, not through the menu.  This is a plus. This camera also uses NiMH batteries.  This is great because you will always have batteries ready to go.  One pro review site rated this camera as one of the best they'd ever seen for battery life.  They said they had no idea how Casio achieved this, but were glad they did.  The memory type is very versatile as well.  You can use Compact Flash type I and II, as well as a Microdrive (up to 1 gig).  You will never run out of memory options here.  The camera also has a very informative LCD, threaded lens, and external flash option.  The camera looks good, feels good, and takes great pictures.  Factor in the relatively low cost, and you have yourself a fun piece of equipment.  I knew when I bought the 2.1 mgpxl camera it would be replaced quickly.  However, I know this camera will be around for a long time.

            [NOTE: I have the Japanese version of this camera. The only difference, though, is the name of the camera (FinePix 1200) and the fact that the user manual and software are in Japanese. :-) ]

I got this camera because I wanted an inexpensive decent digital camera. So far it has been pretty-much everything I thought it would be. The pictures are good and sharp (as long as I don't move while the camera is snapping the picture), and the menus are easy to use and logically laid out. The camera fits easily into my hand, and doesn't have any odd protrusions that make it difficult to use.

I really like how long the batteries last. I've used other digital cameras in the past that drain batteries faster than I can buy (or recharge) them. I know color LCD screens use a lot of power, and I'm glad Fuji came up with one that doesn't consume the power quite as quickly. I also like how the display can be turned off to conserve battery power.

The SmartMedia card is a very convenient way to store the pictures. It's small and transfers the data quickly to the computer. I do recommend getting a SmartMedia card reader, though, so you don't have to waste battery power when you transfer pictures to your computer.

There are only three things I really dislike about this camera: the &quot;zoom&quot;, no DC power cord included, and the software that comes with the camera.

First of all, the &quot;zoom&quot; is just a little switch on one end of the camera. It would have been nice for it to be automatic, though I'm sure that would have raised the price. The close-up setting is for really close close-ups (within about 1 inch). If you try to use it any other time the pictures will be blurry. Most of the time, you will use the camera on the landscape zoom setting (or &quot;infinity&quot; focus).

Second, there is no DC power cord included with the camera. So, unless you spend more money to get one, you have to either buy a SmartMedia card reader or waste battery power to download pictures.

Third, the software that comes with the camera is really quite awful. I recommend not installing it and buying your own image-manipulation software (such as Adobe Photoshop). I also recommend buying a SmartMedia card reader (as I mentioned above) as this will handle the transfer of files much better than the included software. You'll also be able to use the card reader with any other device that uses SmartMedia cards (such as MP3 players, for instance).

Overall, this is a great low-end digital camera. It has its drawbacks, but it does the job, and it's easy to use.<br><br>
